# Coding-Project-1

This is the first revision of reproducing figure 6.13 from the Hastie book, The Elements of Statistical Learning.

This program currently checkes and downloads the required data, and is in the process of creating the kernels.
This Version creates 50 of the kernels on the graph, but does take a while to run (a value just needs to be changed to create all of them, but it takes a very long time to create). Unortunatly, I was unable to make a makefile for this as I was having a few issues with running GNU make.
