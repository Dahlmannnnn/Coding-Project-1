# Coding-Project-1

This MATLAB Code creates a diagram to determine the likelihood of an individual being diagnosed with a heart disease based on the blood pressure of the individual. The dataset used for this is located here:https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/datasets/SAheart.data 
This is also work on reproducing figure 6.13 from the paper [CVXR: An R package for Disciplined Convex Optimization](https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/papers/pdf/cvxr_paper.pdf).
