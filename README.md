# Coding-Project-1

This is the first revision of reproducing figure 6.13 from the Hastie book, The Elements of Statistical Learning.

This program currently checkes and downloads the required data, and is in the process of creating the kernels.
This version is only working on a single kernel as the calculations for all of them will take some time and to speed up the testing process, only a kernel located at the mean is being tested.
